I spent lots of time on the project, maybe 2 weeks.
How I test my code? 
I tested my code through Visual Studio Code, according to the examples of the project to test it. And I submitted on Gradescope to get more tests to do it.
Any bugs or issues I could not resolve? 
I got a lot of issues, I had no idea about it, so TA helped me a lot. The details of the project, like whitspaces, formats and I didn't do it well to load the map to test it, some logical errors, type errors and so on.
An example of a difficult issue or bug and how I resolved?
"Differences are exclusively in whitespace." - that's my most hard issue to fix, TA helped me to fix a lot, like load the map correctly, correct the code to run it well, but the whitespace is really hard to fix. I checked the examples to make it right.
A list of the three extensions Iâ€™ve chosen to implement:
The verb 'help', 'drop' and directions become verbs.
The 'help' verb tells players what the valid verbs are, and it's not simply be static text, it will generated from the verbs that we have defined;
The 'drop' verb is the opposite of 'get': take something from your inventory and put it down in the room. Just as get only lets you get items that are in the room, drop should only let you drop items that you already have;
'Directions become verbs': simply typing 'e' to go east.
