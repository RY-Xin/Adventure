I spent lots of time on the project, maybe 2 weeks.
How I test my code? 
I tested my code through Visual Studio Code, according to the examples of the project to test it. And I submitted on Gradescope to get more tests to do it.
Any bugs or issues I could not resolve? 
I got a lot of issues, I had no idea about it, so TA helped me a lot. The details of the project, like whitspaces, formats and I didn't do it well to load the map to test it, some logical errors, type errors and so on.
An example of a difficult issue or bug and how I resolved?
"Differences are exclusively in whitespace." - that's my most hard issue to fix, TA helped me to fix a lot, like load the map correctly, correct the code to run it well, but the whitespace is really hard to fix.
A list of the three extensions Iâ€™ve chosen to implement:
the verb help, drop and locked door.
